<P ><FONT FACE="Cambria, serif"><FONT SIZE=6>The
Curse of Strahd</FONT></FONT></P>
<P >
</P>
<P ><FONT FACE="Cambria, serif">By
the time you arrive, night has fallen. The Vistani have proven to be
as talkative as they're hospitable and whisked away the hours of your
journey with tales of heroes long forgotten.</FONT></P>
<P ><FONT FACE="Cambria, serif">As
you climb out of one of the carts, you catch a glimpse of a group of
Vistani sitting around an appropriately sized bonfire, singing and
laughing, visibly drunk.</FONT></P>
<P >
</P>
<P >&bdquo;<FONT FACE="Cambria, serif">Well,
'tis our camp. It ain't much, but it's as close to a real home as it
gets,&ldquo; Stanimir says, &bdquo;best you visit Madam Eva in her
tent. You can't miss it, it's twice as large as them others&ldquo;
and so you do.</FONT></P>
<P >
</P>
<P ><FONT FACE="Cambria, serif">Magic
flames cast a reddish glow over the interior of the large pavilion,
revealing a low table covered in a black velvet cloth. Glints of
light seem to flash from a a crystal ball on the table as a hunched
figure peers into its depths. As the crone speaks, her voice crackles
like dry weeds.</FONT></P>
<P >
</P>
<P >&bdquo;<FONT FACE="Cambria, serif">At
last you have arrived!&ldquo; Crackling laughter bursts like mad
lightning from her withered lips. &bdquo;Many years I have waited for
the arrival of worthy heroes and here you stand. Naivara, whose wits
are second to none. Donaar, whose skill at arms is so far-famed that
even in our distant valley of Barovia, we've taken notice of it. Our
need is great, for evil forces have taken hold in our home.&ldquo;</FONT></P>
<P >
</P>
<P >&bdquo;<FONT FACE="Cambria, serif">Well,
here we are, what do want from us?&ldquo; asks Donaar, impatiently
tapping his foot on the floor.</FONT></P>
<P >
</P>
<P >&bdquo;<FONT FACE="Cambria, serif">I
wish for you to know the future the cards have in store.&ldquo;</FONT></P>
<P >
</P>
<P ><FONT FACE="Cambria, serif">With
that, Madam Eva starts to lay out her cards in a peculiar fashion.</FONT></P>
<P >
</P>
<P >&bdquo;<FONT FACE="Cambria, serif">This
card tells you of history. Knowledge of the ancient will help you
better understand your enemy.&ldquo; Eva turns a card and speaks:
&bdquo;Find the Mad Dog's crypt. The treasure lies within, beneath
blackened bones.&ldquo;</FONT></P>
<P >
</P>
<P >&bdquo;<FONT FACE="Cambria, serif">Now
you shall learn of a force for good and protection, a holy symbol of
great hope.&ldquo; Madam Eva smirks to herself, as she intones &bdquo;The
treasure is with a giant whose heart is golden. His name tells tale
of an unfathomable wonder.&ldquo;</FONT></P>
<P >
</P>
<P >&bdquo;<FONT FACE="Cambria, serif">A
tale of power and strength and a weapon of vengeance, the sword of
sunlight. You will find what you seek in the castle, amid the ruins
of a place of supplication.&ldquo;</FONT></P>
<P >
</P>
<P ><FONT FACE="Cambria, serif">As
Naivara flutes &bdquo;sounds like a chapel to me&ldquo;, the old
woman shoots her a glance that would kill a lesser being.</FONT></P>
<P >
</P>
<P >&bdquo;<FONT FACE="Cambria, serif">To
triumph against the dark, you must first find the light. Look for a
dusk elf living among the Vistani. He has suffered a great loss and
is haunted by dark dreams. Help him, and he will help you in return.&ldquo;</FONT></P>
<P >
</P>
<P >&bdquo;<FONT FACE="Cambria, serif">And
finally, a creature of darkness, whose powers are beyond mortality.
He lurks in the darkness where the morning light once shone &ndash; a
sacred place.&ldquo;</FONT></P>
<P >
</P>
<P >&bdquo;<FONT FACE="Cambria, serif">And
since you didn't write that down, here's the script.&ldquo; Madam Eva
hands our heroes a slip of paper, which perfectly reiterates
everything that has happened in the tent.</FONT></P>
<P ><FONT FACE="Cambria, serif">Slightly
perplexed, the unlikely duo leaves the tent to sit at the bonfire,
where a Vistana is telling a story our heroes have not heard before.</FONT></P>
<P >
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 1.11cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; page-break-before: auto">
<FONT FACE="Cambria, serif"><I>	A might wizard came to this land over
a year ago. I remember him like it was yesterday. He stood exactly
where you're standing. A very charismatic man, he was. He thought he
could rally the people of Barovia against the devil Strahd. He
stirred them with thoughts of revolt and bore them to the castle en
masse.</I></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 1.11cm; margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Cambria, serif"><I>	When
the vampire appeared, the wizard's peasant army fled in terror. A few
stood their ground and were never seen against.</I></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 1.11cm; margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Cambria, serif"><I>	The
wizard and the vampire fought each other. Their battle flew from the
courtyards of Ravenloft to a precipice overlooking the falls. I saw
it with my own eyes. Thunder shook the mountainside and a great rock
tumbled down upon the wizard, yet the wizard knew the names of  many
things and when he told the rock to break, it broke. Lightning from
the heavens struck the wizard, but he told the lightning to go fuck
itself with a large cactus and so it did. But when the devil Strahd
fell upon him, the wizard's power couldn't save him. I saw him thrown
a thousand feet to his death. When I climbed down to the river to
search for the wizard's body, to, you know, figure out whether he had
anything interesting on him, the River Ivlis had already spirited him
away.</I></FONT></P>

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.03cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal; page-break-before: auto">
<FONT FACE="Cambria, serif">You go to sleep with the vague feeling,
that the wizard wasn't as vulgar as the Vistana had made him out to
be, and awake to an overcast morning.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal"><FONT FACE="Cambria, serif">Stanimir
informs you that his wagons will stay for the next month and that you
will need to travel by yourself for the time being. You decide to
walk out the rode, as it seems pointless to wander the footpath by
the river. After an hour of walking, you come to a great stone
bridge. To each side, a gargoyle squats on an elevated platform and
the feeling of dread is almost  enough to make you turn around. On
the middle of the bridge, you peer over its side and make out a
magnificent waterfall, pouring down a thousand feet into the depths.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal">
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal"><FONT FACE="Cambria, serif">Just
as you reach the other end of the bridge, a terrible downpour begins
to fall from the skies. Further on ahead, you see an exquisitely
crafted carriage, drawn by two black horses. As you hurry towards it,
its side doors swing open silently. Wanting to get out off the rain,
you step inside.</FONT></P>
