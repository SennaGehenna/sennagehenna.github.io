    Fiasco is a GMless, mostly diceless Roleplaying-Experience, designed to play in single sittings. 
As a group, you will use a playset to determine what story you want to create together.

It is inspired by cinematic tales of small-time capers gone disastrously wrong. You’ll play ordinary people with powerful ambition and poor impulse control. There will be big dreams and ﬂawed execution. It won’t go well for them, to put it mildly, and in the end it will probably collapse into a glorious heap of jealousy, murder, and recrimination. Lives and reputations will be lost, painful wisdom will be gained, and if you are really lucky, your guy just might end up back where he started.
