        <h1 id="creatinggames">Creating or joining games</h1>



        It's up to the players to organize when to play. Ask people if they're interested in joining you on your expedition and see if there's a GM available.<br /><br />
        GMs will enter their availability into the following Google Calendar: <a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=YmQwNTVjNjk5N2tmcDQ0OTFpMHI5Y3IxZDBAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ">Link</a> <br />
        Use it to figure out who has time when.

        <h1 id="aar">After Action Reports</h1>

        After a session it is up to the players to write After Action Reports (commonly referred to as AARs). Writing AARs is a very important part of sharing information with the other players in the land of the West Marches. AARs usually contain information on what happened on the mission and often includes the character's outlook on the mission. <br />
        Feel free to make this an "In Character" report or an "Out of Character" report.<br /><br />
        Common things to include are: locations visited, NPCs encountered, monsters encountered, points of interest, events of interest.<br /><br />

        <b>Every Player who writes at least one AAR after a session will be rewarded with 25 gold.</b>

        <h1 id="adventures">Adventures</h1>

        Adventures will not take place in town. Explore the wilds and find your story.<br/>
        The wilds generally, although not always, grow more dangerous the further you travel, so remember: <br/><br/>
        <b>Running is always an option.</b><br/><br/>
        The players have persistent effects on the world and it will dynamically change around them.
